# AI Design Patterns Library

This document provides a comprehensive catalog of AI design patterns beyond RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). These patterns cover model architecture, training, deployment, monitoring, and system design for AI/ML applications.

## Overview

AI design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in AI/ML system development. This library covers:

- **Model Architecture Patterns**: How to structure and design ML models
- **Training Patterns**: Strategies for training and improving models
- **Deployment Patterns**: How to deploy and serve ML models
- **Data Patterns**: Patterns for data management and processing
- **MLOps Patterns**: Patterns for ML operations and lifecycle management
- **Monitoring Patterns**: Patterns for monitoring and observability
- **Security Patterns**: Patterns for securing AI systems
- **Explainability Patterns**: Patterns for model interpretability and explainability
- **Performance Patterns**: Patterns for optimizing AI system performance

**Note**: RAG-specific patterns are documented separately in the [RAG Patterns](../patterns/README.md) section.
